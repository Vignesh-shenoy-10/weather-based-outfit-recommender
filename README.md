# How did i setup my Development Environment?
1. I used the npx create-react-app weather-dashboard - Although Create-react-app is deprecated, VS-Code did an auto install for me. 
2. Installed dependencies - npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled tailwindcss -> Tailwind css did give me an error, after looking it up I did an npm install -D @tailwindcss/cli
3. I had to configure the global css file that is index.css in order to incorporate tailwind css.
